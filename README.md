# DealershipInventory
This program is created to manage a dealership inventory.
The inventory is initialized with an inventory of five used cars and five new cars.  From this point, the user can sell or lease cars, add cars to the inventory, as well as search the inventory by a user given criteria such as make, model, year, and price.
